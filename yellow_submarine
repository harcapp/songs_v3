C D>In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines<1>So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine<<1>And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play<1>As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine<
